I requested &amp;ldquo;any and all emails to, from, cc&amp;rsquo;d, or bcc&amp;rsquo;d with Gary Genser containing keywords &amp;lsquo;computershare&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;DRS&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;.
There has yet to be a response to this request. This request was appealed twice for not having a response in a timely manner.

After multiple FOIA request/response cycles, the initial 22-00069-FOIA interaction felt off. I was interested in internal communications on why the FOIA office denied the initial request.
This request is unanswered. It was appealed 41 business days after this request was acknowledged.
