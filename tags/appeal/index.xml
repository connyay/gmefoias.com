The General Counsel confirmed the office correctly withheld records due to an ongoing investigation.
Highlight:
I have determined that the FOIA Officer correctly asserted Exemption 7(A). There is a two-step test to determine whether information is protected under Exemption 7(A), whether: (1) a law enforcement proceeding is pending or prospective, and (2) release of information about it could reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm.</description></item><item><title>23-00085-APPS</title><link>/2022/11/23-00085-apps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/11/23-00085-apps/</guid><description>This appeal challenged the lack of timely response to 22-03087-FOIA.

This appeal is unanswered.

The response stated the request was not seeking records and FOIA was not an appropriate venue for questions.
The appeal response partially agreed with the FOIA office, but did provide some information.
Highlight:
In considering your appeal, I have determined that two parts of your request properly seek SEC records: (1) your request for a “count or count estimates of shares of GameStop held by retail investors;” and (2) your request for “a list of broker-dealers responsible for the transactions that have failed to deliver.</description></item></channel></rss>
