I&amp;rsquo;ve sent previous emails to chair@sec.gov; this is the first one I have received a numbered response.

Steps to get to this remend:
Submit 22-00069-FOIA and get rejected (Oct 2021) Submit 22-03086-FOIA and get rejected (Sept 2022) Appeal 23-00004-APPS to get sent back to FOIA office (Oct 2022) Acknowledgement Letter Complex - Still Consulting Letter</description></item><item><title>23-00149-APPS</title><link>/2022/12/23-00149-apps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/12/23-00149-apps/</guid><description>This appeal challenged the lack of timely response to 23-00095-FOIA, yet again (previous appeal). After the first request was appealed the FOIA office stated a response would be ready by March 10, 2023.

The General Counsel confirmed the office correctly withheld records due to an ongoing investigation.
Highlight:
I have determined that the FOIA Officer correctly asserted Exemption 7(A). There is a two-step test to determine whether information is protected under Exemption 7(A), whether: (1) a law enforcement proceeding is pending or prospective, and (2) release of information about it could reasonably be expected to cause some articulable harm.</description></item><item><title>23-00085-APPS</title><link>/2022/11/23-00085-apps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/11/23-00085-apps/</guid><description>This appeal challenged the lack of timely response to 22-03087-FOIA.

There has yet to be a response to this request. This request was appealed twice for not having a response in a timely manner.

The response stated the request was not seeking records and FOIA was not an appropriate venue for questions.
The appeal response partially agreed with the FOIA office, but did provide some information.
Highlight:
In considering your appeal, I have determined that two parts of your request properly seek SEC records: (1) your request for a “count or count estimates of shares of GameStop held by retail investors;” and (2) your request for “a list of broker-dealers responsible for the transactions that have failed to deliver.</description></item><item><title>22-02530-FOIA</title><link>/2022/07/22-02530-foia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/07/22-02530-foia/</guid><description>This request is for very specific data about GameStop shares. This request was filed as the response to 22-01697-FOIA was specific about what was requested. This request received a canned response that did not answer any questions or provide records. This request was appealed.

This series came out at the wrong time, about three months after Gary Gensler appeared on The Problem and mentioned SEC staffers taking donations for coffee in the office.
The SEC acknowledged this request on June 1st and responded on September 20th. 111 days. 76 work days.
The response documents show the SEC spent $366,205 on production and advertising for this series.</description></item><item><title>22-01697-FOIA</title><link>/2022/04/22-01697-foia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/04/22-01697-foia/</guid><description>The SEC gathers and publishes information about institutional owners of stocks but provides no information about retail ownership. I submitted this request seeking information about retail ownership of GameStop.
I received a canned response telling me to search company filings.
This request/response triggered a more detailed 22-02530-FOIA, which was appealed.

I filed this request after a strange series of events transpired in 2021:
April 13, 2021 Commissioner Hester Peirce releases Token Safe Harbor Proposal 2.0 statement - github
May 11, 2021 An article titled &amp;ldquo;The Future Of Tokenized Stocks - What They Can Replace And What To Watch Out For&amp;rdquo; was released.</description></item></channel></rss>
