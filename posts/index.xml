This request is unanswered. It was appealed 41 business days after this request was acknowledged.

The appeal response partially agreed with the FOIA office, but did provide some information.
Highlight:
In considering your appeal, I have determined that two parts of your request properly seek SEC records: (1) your request for a “count or count estimates of shares of GameStop held by retail investors;” and (2) your request for “a list of broker-dealers responsible for the transactions that have failed to deliver.</description></item><item><title>22-02530-FOIA</title><link>/2022/07/22-02530-foia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/07/22-02530-foia/</guid><description>This request is for very specific data about GameStop shares. This request was filed as the response to 22-01697-FOIA was specific about what was requested. This request received a canned response that did not answer any questions or provide records. This request was appealed.

This series came out at the wrong time, about three months after Gary Gensler appeared on The Problem and mentioned SEC staffers taking donations for coffee in the office.
The SEC acknowledged this request on June 1st and responded on September 20th. 111 days. 76 work days.
The response documents show the SEC spent $366,205 on production and advertising for this series.</description></item><item><title>22-01697-FOIA</title><link>/2022/04/22-01697-foia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2022/04/22-01697-foia/</guid><description>The SEC gathers and publishes information about institutional owners of stocks but provides no information about retail ownership. I submitted this request seeking information about retail ownership of GameStop.
I received a canned response telling me to search company filings.
This request/response triggered a more detailed 22-02530-FOIA, which was appealed.

I filed this request after a strange series of events transpired in 2021.
